# memory-game
Simple memory game made in Vue. Just run commands below to install packages and run it.

To play, press "Start" button and click on the cards in order to find the pair. Attempts are used to calculate final score. The game is timed. 

I´ve tried to keep visual coherence with Avalanche's website (buttons, colors, tipography...). I'd use more time to improve scores page with some animations.

Hope You enjoy it as I´ve enjoyed developing it!
